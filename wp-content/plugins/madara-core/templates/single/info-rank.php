	 * The Template for printing out a manga property (Rank) in Manga Detail page
	 *
	 * This template can be overridden by copying it to your-child-theme/madara-core/single/info-rank.php
	 *
	 * HOWEVER, on occasion Madara will need to update template files and you
	 * (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
	 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
	 * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
	 * we will list any important changes on our theme release logs.
	 * @package Madara
	 * @version 1.7.2.2
