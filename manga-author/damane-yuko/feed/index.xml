One thing though: she can&#8217;t use modern technology inside the house whatsoever?! Which means no vacuums, no cellphones, no laptops, etc. What is up with her twisted, but handsome, employer Asakura Shiyuusei-san? And what exactly is he hiding in his storage room&#8230;? From Intercross: 16-year-old Hina&#8217;s first job is with a 19th-century British enthusiast, Shuusei-san, as his maid. Even the way of cleaning has to be from the 19th century! Even so, this sweet gentleman makes Hina&#8217;s heart beat so fast! There is actually another person in this residence, Mary Lou. She&#8217;s as cute as a doll, but&#8230; she&#8217;s, she&#8217;s&#8230; a ghost?!</p>
